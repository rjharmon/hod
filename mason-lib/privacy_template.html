<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>First, review the statement/policy below.  If, and ONLY if, you agree to 
conform to this statement/policy, then you may proceed to use this template.</p>

<p>Create a <code>/privacy_statement.html</code> in your web site, including 
any site-specific calls for titles, backgrounds, and so on. At the top, use 
the following call:</p>
<pre><% <<EOD
<\& /privacy_template.html &\>
<\& /email_display.m, 
	email => 'webmaster\@yourcompany.com',
	subject => "Privacy Policy",
	name => "Webmaster at Your Company Name", #optional
	label => 'webmaster\@yourcompany.com' #optional
\&>
EOD
 |h %>
</pre>

<p>The template, as shown below, does <b><i>not</i></b> include an email 
address for contact, so you must include an email address.  For more 
information about email obfuscation, see
<a href="/doc.html?module=/email_display.m">the documentation for 
<code>/email_display.m</code></a>.</p>

<p>Use </code>/privacy_policy.html</code> to link your visitors to your new 
security statement.</p>

<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>

<p>As a user of the internet and a citizen of the technology age, your
privacy is one of the concerns we must always take into account.  In order
to ensure your privacy, we take a number of <a href="#technical">technical
steps</a> to prevent the acquisition of your personal information by third
parties and we have a strict policy of <a href="#use">how we use</a> the
information you provide.</p>

<a name="technical"></a><h3>Technical Measures to protect your privacy</h3>

<p>To ensure that your information is not collected by third parties, we
employ technical measures to hide details about your interests, your
finances and your account information.  </p>

<p>Once you enter the ordering process, we use a <a href="security_statement.html">secure
web</a> connection to prevent other people from seeing the products you take an interest
in.  When you transmit your information over that connection, it's encrypted to protect
you from prying eyes.</p>

<p>We use a browser cookie that's stored by your web browser, to distinguish
your browsing session from those of other visitors.  The cookie contains NO 
personal information; it is simply a unique identifier.  The cookies use 
cryptographic techniques to thwart potential attackers from guessing your
cookie value.
</p>

<p>One of the other technical ways we protect your privacy is that we NEVER
hold your credit card number in cleartext on our server.  For your
protection, any credit card information we store will be encrypted using
public keys held at remote locations.  From a technical perspective, 
your privacy is our top concern.</p>

<a name="use"></a><h3>How we use your information</h3>

<P>Our primary use for your information is to fulfill your order.  We may
also use a logged record of your clickpath to help identify problems with
our web sites, areas for improvement, and to gauge popularity of different
product lines.</p>

<p>Other uses of your information may include contacting you by email to
tell you about new products which you may have interest in, based on your
other purchases with us.  If you wish to stop receiving such contacts, 
that is your right and we will promptly comply.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3> <p>In this internet age, personal privacy and security
is a critical part of both your responsibility and ours.  If we may do
anything to improve your feeling of privacy at our web site, or if you 
have questions about any privacy issue, please feel free to contact us at
