<!-- Changes:  Sandeep V. Tamhankar (stamhankar@hotmail.com) -->

/* 1.1.2: Fixed a bug where trailing . in e-mail address was passing
            (the bug is actually in the weak regexp engine of the browser; I
            simplified the regexps to make it work).
   1.1.1: Removed restriction that countries must be preceded by a domain,
            so abc@host.uk is now legal.  However, there's still the 
            restriction that an address must end in a two or three letter
            word.
     1.1: Rewrote most of the function to conform more closely to RFC 822.
     1.0: Original  */
