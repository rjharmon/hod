Shared javascript for checking email address validity.
</%method>
<%method .doc>
<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>This JavaScript is used for easy checking of the validity of
email address formats entered into web forms.</p>

<pre>
<% <<EOD
<script language="Javascript" 
   src="/email_check.js"></script>
...
<input type=text onChange="return emailCheck(this.value)">
-- or --
<form onSubmit="return emailCheck(this.value)">
EOD
|h %>
</pre>

<p>If any formatting errors are found in the email address, an alert dialog
is displayed and the function returns false.</p>

<p>Other calling methods than those in the example above may be useful as
well.  For instance, if you wish to check multiple fields for validity, a
single onSubmit handler for a form could call the emailCheck() function as
well as other functions.</p>

<h2>Parameters</h2>
<p>None.</p>
