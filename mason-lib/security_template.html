<h3>Security Statement</h3>

<p>Many people are concerned about the security of their credit card number and 
<a href="privacy_policy.html">private information</a> when placing orders over 
the Internet.  To address this concern, our site 
employs &quot;Secure Sockets Layer&quot;(SSL) security protocol which
provides data encryption, message integrity and server authentication.
</p>

<p>Data Encryption makes it virtually impossible for unauthorized people to view information traveling
between computers.  Information sent between computers is cryptographically encoded by the
sender and then decoded by the receiver.  If the encoded message is not received intact 
it can not be decoded thereby ensuring the that the data passing between you and our servers 
has not been modified in any way.
</p>

<p>Server Authentication confirms a server's identity by ensuring that the 
server's certificate and public ID are valid and have been issued by a recognized Certificate 
Authority (CA). Confirming a server's identity before sending a credit card number over the
Internet is important to ensure you aren't sending your credit card information to someone other
than the intended party.
</p>

<p>To benefit from the features of SSL you must use a browser such as 
Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape, Opera and AOL browsers 
to ensure your information is submitted with a high level of 
security. To verify SSL security is in effect look for the secure symbol typically 
represented a "key" or "lock" located in the bottom or top corners of the browser.
