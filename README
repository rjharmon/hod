Hod - Masonry tools for Mason web sites

This repository contains a variety of Mason components developed primarily
by Randy Harmon <r_j_h_box-sf@yahoo.com>.

Mason is a perl-based templating system.  http://www.masonhq.com.  Hod
provides components that use Mason to provide many useful tools for building
websites.  


Feature Highlights

* Mailer (aka "Contact Us" form)

* Database Record create/read/update/delete, with easily customizable data
  entry forms

* Database Record lists, including paging and customizable display
  formatting

* User authentication and logins, with permission settings for all features
  provided by Hod (and maybe a couple extra ones :)

* User-session capturing, including HTTP referer capture and reporting

* Ensuring https:// connections

* Online store

* Pluggable shipping options for online store including flat-rate, tiered
  based on order amount, and live UPS Shipping options + costing based on
  destination address.  Note, the UPS module's protocol version might or 
  might not remain supported by UPS's online service (untested lately).

* Pluggable payment processing for online store, including AuthorizeNet and
  Echo.  Note, these payment modules may use protocol versions no longer
  supported by these vendors (untested lately).


Configuration

To use Hod tools, configure Apache/Mason to process .html files through Mason. 
Do not allow .m files to be processed by Apache/Mason - more specifically,
deny webserver access to these files completely.

Next, configure the Hod directory as the first component root, and configure 
your website as the second component root.  Make calls to these components as 
if they were part of your web root.  For .html files, you can link directly to
them.  For .m files, these need to be called from .html mason components -
either ones that you write or ones provided by Hod.

Finally, ensure that the Hod lib/ directory is part of Perl's library path,
using 'use lib'.  You might also want to preload some or all of the
libraries found there.


Security and Other notes

* Update the vcode generation according to notes in the source file under
  session/.  This is important for site security.

* Your server should be able to accept mail and forward it to addresses at
  your domain.  

* There are some source files that have email addresses hardcoded, possibly
  to addresses that don't really work.  You might wish to review them and 
  identify these cases, updating them as you need.

More Reading

For further documentation, please do one or more of the following:

* Set up your website according to the instructions above, then visit
  /docs.html.  This component scans the entire component tree and exposes
  the documentation written for each component.

* Browse the document tree directly, and view the documentation defined for
  most of the components.  

* See the store/ directory, which provides components for a complete web-based
  store.  This would be the learn-by-example method.

* The Order reports' graphs require some truetype fonts in /fonts.
